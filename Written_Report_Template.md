# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    
### Purpose
-The statistical data set has summerized the detailes of campaigns in different categories, including fundraising goals, outcomes, description of the project, status of fund racing and their locations. 
-The purpose of this project is to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to the according launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
        The amount of successful (fund raised exceeded the goal), failed(fun raised did not reach the goal) and canceled (project did not conduct) projects within each months were organized into a pivot table and a line graph.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
        Number of successful, failed and canceled projects were determined under different intervals of gundrasing goal. Percentage of successful, failed and canceled project were calculated for each of the intervals and shown in a line graph.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
        While generating the pivot table for outcomes based on launch date, the year and date would have to be removed in the axis catagory so that only month is on display of the row lables.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    --Most of the projects were successful while reaching a peak in the middle of year around April to August, while January and December has the lowest amount of campaigns reaching their fundraising goals. Mostly, the project that did not successed were failed to raise the target amount of fund, while the only a very few of the projects were canceled; except that in June roughly the same amount of the projects were failed and canceled. Based on this data, the best date to launch a campaign would be in May and October, since these two months have the highest amount of successed projects.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100896537/158046197-73f29fad-c6cd-450c-9986-5ace13ad0080.png)

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    -- Campaigns with a fund rasinf goal of >50000 USD had the highest successful percentage, with the lowest percentage of failed or canceled campaigns as well. However, as a general trend, the percentage of successful campaigns decrease with the increase of the amount of fundrasing goal.![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100896537/158046200-3ca14024-9dad-4242-a482-c26aa9705554.png)

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    -- There could be other counfounders affecting the campaigns to reach the goal in different catagories needs to be take into account. Such as the person runnng the campaigns, number of participants.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    -- Pivot Table of outcomes by categories
 to see which types of campaigns have the highest successful rate.
    -- Piot table of outcomes by different countries and categories.
